# squan-reconner
does reconstruction for square-1 solves 

HOW TO SETUP:
download processing at https://processing.org/download and the code
download the PeasyCam library by going to (Sketch)>> (Import Library...) >> (Manage Library...) then search for PeasyCam and install it

HOW TO USE:
all moves are notated in the formal notation e.g. /(a,b)/(c,d)
to set up the cube to be scrambled/in a specific state at the start, paste your scramble in the setupmoves string
to do moves that will be animated, type in the moves string
once done, run the program and press space to start the animation (you can use your mouse to orbit around the cube)

HOW TO CUSTOMISE:
the float speed controls how fast the animations play (default 0.85, greater speed plays animation faster, lower speed plays animation slower)
to change colour scheme/colours:
default colour scheme is B/W, for other colour schemes, change the top and bottom colours in polescol {}
